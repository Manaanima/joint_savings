# Joint Savings

## Overview
This is a Solidity smart contract that automates the creation of joint savings accounts that accepts two user addresses. The contract contains functions that allow the user to:
<ul>
<li>set the two accounts</li>
<li>deposit</li>
<li>withdraw</li>
<li>check the balance of the contract</li>
<li>the last withdrawal amount</>
<li>the last address to make a withdrawal</li>
<li>and a default fallback</li>
</ul>

Once both addresses are set and Ethereum is deposited into the contract's balance, the deposited Ethereum can then be distributed between the accounts.
